# Secure Exam Desktop Application Test Summary

## 1. Introduction
This document summarizes the testing efforts for the Secure Exam Desktop application. The application is designed to provide a secure environment for conducting online exams, with features for authentication, exam creation, exam taking, and result management.

## 2. Testing Approach
The testing approach followed the test plan outlined in TestPlan.md. The focus was on unit testing key components of the application to ensure they function correctly in isolation. The following components were tested:

1. Question model (QuestionTest)
2. Local cache (LocalCacheTest)
3. Configuration loading (ConfigLoaderTest)
4. Network management (NetworkManagerTest)

## 3. Test Results

### 3.1 Question Model Tests
All tests for the Question class passed successfully. The tests verified:
- Question creation and property access
- Validation for invalid options (less than 4)
- Validation for invalid correct answer (not in options)
- Setting new options
- Validation when setting options that don't include the correct answer

### 3.2 Local Cache Tests
Initially, the LocalCache tests failed due to SQL syntax issues. The LocalCache class was using SQLite syntax (INSERT OR REPLACE) but the database was H2, which uses different syntax. After fixing these issues, all tests passed successfully. The tests verified:
- Question caching (saving and retrieving questions)
- Submission caching (saving and retrieving answers)
- Marking submissions as synced
- Cache cleanup

### 3.3 Configuration Loading Tests
All tests for the ConfigLoader class passed successfully. The tests verified:
- Loading institute name from configuration
- Loading Firebase configuration
- Loading default time limit

### 3.4 Network Management Tests
All tests for the NetworkManager class passed successfully. The tests verified:
- Checking online status
- Disabling internet access
- Enabling internet access
- Offline mode functionality

## 4. Issues Found and Fixed

### 4.1 LocalCache SQL Syntax
**Issue**: The LocalCache class was using SQLite syntax (INSERT OR REPLACE) but the database was H2, which uses different syntax.

**Fix**: Updated the saveQuestions and saveSubmission methods to use H2-compatible syntax:
- For saveQuestions: Implemented a two-step process (delete existing questions, then insert new ones)
- For saveSubmission: Implemented a check-then-update-or-insert approach

### 4.2 JUnit Dependencies
**Issue**: The project was missing JUnit dependencies, which prevented running tests.

**Fix**: Added JUnit 5 dependencies to the pom.xml file:
- junit-jupiter-api
- junit-jupiter-engine

### 4.3 Maven Surefire Plugin
**Issue**: The project was missing the Maven Surefire Plugin, which is needed to run tests during the Maven build lifecycle.

**Fix**: Added the Maven Surefire Plugin to the pom.xml file with configuration to include all files that end with "Test.java".

### 4.4 JavaFX Web Dependency
**Issue**: The project was missing the JavaFX web dependency, which is needed by the GoogleAuthHelper class.

**Fix**: Added the JavaFX web dependency to the pom.xml file.

## 5. Recommendations for Further Testing

### 5.1 Integration Testing
The current tests focus on unit testing individual components. Integration tests should be developed to verify that components work correctly together. For example:
- Test the interaction between TestManager and LocalCache
- Test the interaction between ExamController and NetworkManager

### 5.2 UI Testing
The current tests do not cover the user interface. UI tests should be developed to verify that the user interface works correctly. This could include:
- Testing the login screen
- Testing the student dashboard
- Testing the instructor dashboard
- Testing the admin dashboard
- Testing the exam interface

### 5.3 End-to-End Testing
End-to-end tests should be developed to verify complete workflows, such as:
- Student taking an exam from login to submission
- Instructor creating an exam and viewing results
- Admin managing users

### 5.4 Performance Testing
Performance tests should be developed to verify that the application performs well under load. This could include:
- Testing with a large number of questions
- Testing with a large number of students
- Testing with a large number of exams

## 6. Conclusion
The testing efforts have verified that key components of the Secure Exam Desktop application function correctly in isolation. Several issues were found and fixed, improving the reliability of the application. Further testing is recommended to verify that components work correctly together and that the application as a whole meets its requirements.
